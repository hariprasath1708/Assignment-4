# Assignment-4


📍 Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, costs, and workplace morale. This project focuses on analyzing key factors that contribute to employee attrition and building a predictive machine learning model to forecast whether an employee is likely to leave or stay.

🎯 Project Goals
✅ Analyze factors influencing attrition (salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.).
✅ Use machine learning to predict attrition based on employee data.
✅ Apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and class balancing (SMOTE).
✅ Build and optimize models using GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.
✅ Deploy a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

📊 Data Analysis & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in attrition.
Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Class imbalance handled using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM) - Optimized using hyperparameter tuning.
Random Forest Classifier - Used for benchmarking.
GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV - Improve performance & speed.
🚀 Model Deployment with Streamlit
Users enter employee details in a simple Streamlit interface.
Real-time attrition prediction (Likely to Stay / Likely to Leave).
Model loads dynamically from a .pkl file for fast predictions.
💡 Key Benefits
🔹 Helps HR teams identify at-risk employees early.
🔹 Reduces hiring and training costs by improving retention strategies.
🔹 Enables data-driven decision-making in workforce management.
🔹 Provides a real-time attrition prediction tool for businesses.

🎯 Final Output
✅ Well-trained attrition prediction model.
✅ User-friendly web app for making predictions.
✅ Accurate insights to help organizations reduce attrition.
